## Purpose
MyMusicBand is a WebApp on which a user can create music bands with friends, share resources (music sheets, tabs, lyrics, inspirations...), leave comments, share recordings, or record him/herself directly online, with the music sheet automatically scrolling while he/she plays. The user can also select recordings, mix them, and download the result!!

Project presented @LeWagon during Demo Day (see video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ3Zk3P9iX0&feature=emb_logo#t=23m35).
